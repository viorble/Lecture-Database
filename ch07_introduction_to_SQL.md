# Chapter7: Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL)
- SQL is composed of commands that enable users
  -  create database and table structures
  -  perform various types of data manipulation
  -  execute data administration
  -  query the database to extract useful information.
- All RDBMS supports SQL, and many software vendors have developed extensions to the basic SQL command set.

# SQL Basics
- Described in ANSI/ISO SQL
  - The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) prescribes a standard SQL.
  - International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also accept.
- SQL functions fit into several broad categories:
  - Data manipulation language (DML)
  - Data definition language (DDL)
  - Transaction control language (TCL)
  - Data control language (DCL)
- SQL is a nonprocedural language

# Basic Data Types
- Numeric
- Character
- Date
![bg right:60% w:100%](restricted/CTable08_01.jpg)

# MySQL Data Types
- String: char, varchar, text
- Numeric: int, tinyint, boolean, decimal, float
- Date: date, time, datetime

[List of MySQL Data Types](https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/mysql_datatypes.asp)

# Steps to Develop Database
1. Design ER model (Fig 7.1 or Fig 8.1)
2. Create database 
3. Create database **schema** (a logical group of database objects, like tables and indexes)
4. Insert data

# Step1: Analyze Biz Rules to Design ER Model
- A customer may generate many invoices. Each invoice is generated by one customer.
- An invoice contains one or more invoice lines. Each invoice line is associated with
one invoice.
- Each invoice line references one product. A product may be found in many invoice lines.
- A vendor may supply many products. Some vendors do not yet supply products.
- If a product is vendor-supplied, it is supplied by only a single vendor.
- Some products are not supplied by a vendor.

# Step1: Deliver ER Diagram
![bg right:65% w:90%](restricted/CFig07_01.jpg)

# Step2: Create Database (CH07_SALECO)
- Database stores database schema, a group of database objects

```sql
  CREATE DATABASE CH07_SALECO;
  CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS CH07_SALECO;
  SHOW DATABASES;
  USE CH07_SALECO;
```
# Step3: Create Database Tables

<div class="columns">
<div>

## VENDOR table
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS VENDOR (
  V_CODE INT PRIMARY KEY,
  V_NAME VARCHAR(35) NOT NULL,
  V_CONTACT VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
  V_AREACODE CHAR(3) NOT NULL,
  V_PHONE CHAR(8) NOT NULL,
  V_STATE CHAR(2) NOT NULL,
  V_ORDER CHAR(1) NOT NULL
);
```  
</div>

<div>

## PRODUCT table
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS PRODUCT (
  P_CODE VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
  P_DESCRIPT VARCHAR(35) NOT NULL,
  P_INDATE DATETIME NOT NULL,
  P_QOH INTEGER NOT NULL,
  P_MIN INTEGER NOT NULL,
  P_PRICE NUMERIC(8,2) NOT NULL,
  P_DISCOUNT NUMERIC(4,2) NOT NULL,
  V_CODE INTEGER,
  CONSTRAINT fk_product_vendor FOREIGN KEY (V_CODE) REFERENCES VENDOR (V_CODE)
);
```

# Data in Database
![bg right:70% w:90%](restricted/CFig08_02.jpg)

# SQL Queries
- Many SQL queries are used to perform actions such as adding or deleting rows or changing attribute values within tables
- Data retrieval is done in SQL using a SELECT query
- A SQL set-oriented command works over a set of rows
- A SELECT query specifies which data should be retrieved and how it should be filtered, aggregated, and displayed

# Basic SELECT Queries
Each clause in a SELECT query performs the following functions:
- SELECT – specifies the attributes to be returned by the query
- FROM – specifies the table(s) from which the data will be retrieved
- WHERE – filters the rows of data based on provided criteria
- GROUP BY – groups the rows of data into collections based on sharing the same values in one or more attributes
- HAVING – filters the groups formed in the GROUP BY clause based on provided criteria
- ORDER BY – sorts the final query result rows in ascending or descending order based on the values of one or more attributes

# SELECT Statement Options
```sql
  SELECT 	columnlist
  FROM 		tablelist;
```  
- A wildcard character is a symbol that can be used as a general substitute for other characters or commands
  - \* : all columns
  - % : matches zero or more characters
  - _ : matches exactly one character

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'J%'; (John, James)
SELECT * FROM products WHERE code LIKE 'A_1'; (A01, AB1)
```

# Column Definition of PRODUCT and VENDOR
![bg right:70% w:90%](restricted/CTable08_02.jpg)

# Table: CH07_SALECO PRODUCT
Database (Schema): CH07_SALECO
Table: PRODUCT
![bg right:70% w:90%](restricted/CFig07_02.jpg)

# Select an Entire PRODUCT Table
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM CH07_SALECO.PRODUCT;

USE CH07_SALECO;
SELECT * 
FROM PRODUCT;
```
  <div class="middle-grid">
    <img src="restricted/CFig07_02.jpg" alt="">
</div> 

# Select with a Column List
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, P_QOH 
FROM CH07_SALECO.PRODUCT;
```
<div class="middle-grid">
    <img src="restricted/CFig07_03.jpg" alt="">
</div>

# Using Column Aliases
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT AS DESCRIPTION, P_PRICE AS "UNIT PRICE", P_QOH AS QTY  
FROM CH07_SALECO.PRODUCT;
```
<div class="middle-grid">
    <img src="restricted/CFig07_04.jpg" alt="">
</div>

# Using Computed Columns
```sql
SELECT P_DESCRIPT AS DESCRIPTION, P_PRICE AS "UNIT PRICE", P_QOH AS QTY, P_QOH * P_PRICE AS "TOTAL VALUE"  
FROM CH07_SALECO.PRODUCT;
```
<div class="middle-grid">
    <img src="restricted/CFig07_06.jpg" alt="">
</div>

# Date Arithmetic
- Follow the rules of precedence
- +, -, *, /, div, %, mod
```sql
SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, P_QOH, P_QOH * P_PRICE AS "TOTAL VALUE"  
FROM CH07_SALECO.PRODUCT;
```

# Listing Unique Values
SQL’s DISTINCT clause produces a list of only those values that are different from one another
```sql
SELECT 	DISTINCT V_CODE
FROM 		PRODUCT;
```
<div class="middle-grid">
    <img src="restricted/CFig07_07.jpg" alt="">
</div>

# FROM Clause Options
- The FROM clause of the query specifies the table or tables from which the data is to be retrieved
- Only columns in the table specified in the FROM clause are available throughout the rest of the query
- Multiple tables must be combined using a type of JOIN operation

# ORDER BY Clause Options

```sql
SELECT 	columnlist
FROM 		tablelist
[ORDER BY	columnlist [ASC|DESC] ];
```  
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_QOH, P_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT
ORDER BY P_PRICE;
```
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_QOH, P_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT
ORDER BY P_PRICE DESC;
```
```sql
SELECT EMP_LNAME, EMP_FNAME, EMP_INITIAL, EMP_PHONE
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY EMP_LNAME, EMP_FNAME, EMP_INITIAL;
```

# WHERE Clause Options
- Comparison operator: =, <, <=, >, >=, <> or !=
```sql
SELECT columnlist
FROM tablelist
[WHERE conditionlist ]
[ORDER BY columnlist [ASC | DESC] ];
```

# Using Comparison Operator on Numeric Attribute 
```sql
SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_INDATE, P_PRICE, V_CODE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE V_CODE = 21344;

SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_QOH, P_MIN, P_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE P_PRICE <= 10;
```

# Using Comparison Operator on Character Attribute  
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_QOH, P_MIN, P_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE P_CODE < '1558-QW1';
```
# Using Comparison Operator on Date Attribute  
```sql
SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_QOH, P_MIN, P_PRICE, P_INDATE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE P_INDATE >= '2021-11-05';
```
# Logical Operators: AND, OR and NOT
```sql
SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_INDATE, P_PRICE, V_CODE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE P_PRICE < 50 AND P_INDATE > '2021-01-01';

/* use parentheses and 
compare below two select statements */
SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_CODE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE (V_CODE = 25595 OR V_CODE = 24288) AND P_PRICE > 100;
SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_CODE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE V_CODE = 25595 OR V_CODE = 24288 AND P_PRICE > 100;
-- AND before OR --

SELECT *
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE NOT (V_CODE = 21344);
``` 

# Special Operators in WHERE Clause
- BETWEEN – Used to check whether an attribute value is within a range
- IN – Used to check whether an attribute value matches any value within a value list
- LIKE – Used to check whether an attribute value matches a given string pattern
- IS NULL – Used to check whether an attribute value is null
- NOT – Used to negate a condition

# Illustrations of Special Operators
```sql
SELECT *
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE P_PRICE BETWEEN 50.00 AND 100.00;
SELECT *
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE V_CODE IN (21344, 24288);
SELECT V_NAME, V_CONTACT, V_AREACODE, V_PHONE
FROM VENDOR
WHERE V_CONTACT LIKE 'Smith%';
-- wildcard % for zero or more chars, _ for any one char
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, V_CODE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE V_CODE IS NULL;
SELECT V_NAME, V_CONTACT, V_AREACODE, V_PHONE
FROM VENDOR
WHERE UPPER(V_CONTACT) NOT LIKE 'SMITH%';
```
# JOIN Operations
JOIN operators are used to combine data from multiple tables
- Inner joins return only rows from the tables that match on a common value
- Outer joins return the same matched rows as the inner join, plus unmatched rows from one table or the other
  - Left (outer) join
  - Right (outer) join
  - Full (outer) join

# JOIN Illustration
<div class="grid">
    <img src="files/image/four_join_types.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="files/image/join_example.jpg" alt="">
</div>

# Three Ways to Do Inner Join (Join)
```sql
-- JOIN USING
SELECT column-list FROM table1 JOIN table2 USING (common-column)

-- JOIN ON
SELECT column-list FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON join-condition

-- Old-style JOIN
SELECT column-list FROM table1, table2 WHERE table1.column = table2.column
```
- In practice, **JOIN ON** is typically considered as a preference.

# Example of JOIN USING
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, V_CODE, V_NAME, V_AREACODE, V_PHONE
FROM PRODUCT JOIN VENDOR USING (V_CODE);
```
# Example of JOIN ON
```sql
SELECT INVOICE.INV_NUMBER, PRODUCT.P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, LINE_UNITS, LINE_PRICE
FROM INVOICE
JOIN LINE ON INVOICE.INV_NUMBER = LINE.INV_NUMBER 
JOIN PRODUCT ON LINE.P_CODE = PRODUCT.P_CODE;

-- Compare to JOIN ON
SELECT INV_NUMBER, P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, LINE_UNITS, LINE_PRICE
FROM INVOICE 
JOIN LINE USING(INV_NUMBER) 
JOIN PRODUCT USING(P_CODE);
```

# Example of Old-Style JOIN
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_NAME
FROM PRODUCT, VENDOR
WHERE PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE;

-- Compare to JOIN USING
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_NAME
FROM PRODUCT JOIN VENDOR USING(V_CODE);

-- Compare to JOIN ON
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_NAME
FROM PRODUCT JOIN VENDOR ON PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE;
```
- The task of joining the tables is split across both the FROM and WHERE which makes complex queries more difficult to maintain
- They are susceptible to undetected errors

# Illustrate Why Old-Style Join is Not Preferred
```sql
-- Get wrong result and easy to find no condition when join PRODUCT
SELECT CUS_FNAME, CUS_LNAME, V_NAME
FROM CUSTOMER
JOIN INVOICE ON CUSTOMER.CUS_CODE = INVOICE.CUS_CODE
JOIN LINE ON INVOICE.INV_NUMBER = LINE.INV_NUMBER
JOIN PRODUCT
JOIN VENDOR ON PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE
WHERE V_STATE = 'TN';

-- Get wrong result and hard to debug
SELECT CUS_FNAME, CUS_LNAME, V_NAME
FROM CUSTOMER, INVOICE, LINE, PRODUCT, VENDOR
WHERE V_STATE = 'TN' 
AND CUSTOMER.CUS_CODE = INVOICE.CUS_CODE 
AND INVOICE.INV_NUMBER = LINE.INV_NUMBER
AND PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE;
```

# Outer Joins
Three types of outer join: Left (outer) join, Right (outer) join, Full (outer) join

# Left Outer Join
```sql
SELECT column-list
FROM table1 LEFT[OUTER] JOIN table2 ON join-condition

SELECT P_CODE, VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME
FROM VENDOR 
LEFT JOIN PRODUCT ON VENDOR.V_CODE = PRODUCT.V_CODE;
```

# Right Outer Join
```sql
SELECT column-list
FROM table1 RIGHT[OUTER] JOIN table2 ON join-condition

SELECT P_CODE, VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME
FROM VENDOR 
RIGHT JOIN PRODUCT ON VENDOR.V_CODE = PRODUCT.V_CODE;

SELECT VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME, P_CODE
FROM PRODUCT 
RIGHT JOIN VENDOR ON PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE
WHERE P_CODE IS NULL;
```

# Full Outer Join
```sql
SELECT column-list
FROM table1 FULL[OUTER] JOIN table2 ON join-condition

SELECT P_CODE, VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME
FROM VENDOR
FULL JOIN PRODUCT ON VENDOR.V_CODE = PRODUCT.V_CODE;
```
