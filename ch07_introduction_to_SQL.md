# Introduction to MySQL
- MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS)
- MySQL is open-source and free
- MySQL is ideal for both small and large applications
- MySQL is very fast, reliable, scalable, and easy to use
- MySQL is cross-platform
- MySQL is compliant with the ANSI SQL standard
- MySQL was first released in 1995
- MySQL is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation
- MySQL is named after co-founder Monty Widenius's daughter, My

# SQL Statement in MySQL
- SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT
- Use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement to separate each SQL statement
- Some of The Most Important SQL Commands
 <span class='small-text'>
INSERT INTO - [C]eate new data into a database
SELECT - [R]ead data from a database
UPDATE - [U]pdates data in a database
DELETE - [D]eletes data from a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database; ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table; ALTER TABLE - modifies a table; DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key); DROP INDEX - deletes an index</span>

# Chapter7: Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL)
- SQL is composed of commands that enable users
  -  create database and table structures
  -  perform various types of data manipulation
  -  execute data administration
  -  query the database to extract useful information.
- All RDBMS supports SQL, and many software vendors have developed extensions to the basic SQL command set.

# SQL Basics
- Described in ANSI/ISO SQL
  - The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) prescribes a standard SQL.
  - International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also accept.
- SQL functions fit into several broad categories:
  - Data manipulation language (DML): INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
  - Data definition language (DDL): CREATE TABLE
  - Transaction control language (TCL): COMMIT, ROLLBACK
  - Data control language (DCL): GRANT, REVOKE
- SQL is a nonprocedural language, including many set operators

# Steps to Develop Database
1. Design ER model (Fig 7.1 or Fig 8.1)
2. Create database 
3. Create database **schema** (a logical group of database objects, like tables and indexes)
4. Insert data

# Step1A: Analyze Biz Rules to Design ER Model
- A customer may generate many invoices. Each invoice is generated by one customer.
- An invoice contains one or more invoice lines. Each invoice line is associated with
one invoice.
- Each invoice line references one product. A product may be found in many invoice lines.
- A vendor may supply many products. Some vendors do not yet supply products.
- If a product is vendor-supplied, it is supplied by only a single vendor.
- Some products are not supplied by a vendor.

# Step1B: Deliver ER Diagram
![bg right:65% w:90%](restricted/CFig07_01.jpg)

# Step1C: Data Dict
![bg right:80% w:90%](restricted/CTable08_02.jpg)

# Step2: Create Database (MySQL syntax)
```sql
CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] database_name;
```
Database (schema) name: IIM_SALECO or EPPS_SALECO
```sql
CREATE DATABASE EPPS_SALECO;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS EPPS_SALECO;
USE EPPS_SALECO;
```
# Step3: Create Database Tables (MySQL syntax)
```sql
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name (
  column_name1 data_type [column_constraints],
  column_name2 data_type [column_constraints],
  ...
  [table_constraints]
);
```

# Create VENDOR Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS VENDOR (
  V_CODE INT,
  V_NAME VARCHAR(35) NOT NULL,
  V_CONTACT VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
  V_AREACODE CHAR(3) NOT NULL,
  V_PHONE CHAR(8) NOT NULL,
  V_STATE CHAR(2) NOT NULL,
  V_ORDER CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (V_CODE)
);
```

# Create PRODUCT Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS PRODUCT (
  P_CODE VARCHAR(10),
  P_DESCRIPT VARCHAR(35) NOT NULL,
  P_INDATE DATETIME NOT NULL,
  P_QOH INTEGER NOT NULL,
  P_MIN INTEGER NOT NULL,
  P_PRICE NUMERIC(8,2) NOT NULL,
  P_DISCOUNT NUMERIC(4,2) NOT NULL,
  V_CODE INTEGER,
  PRIMARY KEY (P_CODE),
  FOREIGN KEY (V_CODE) REFERENCES VENDOR (V_CODE)
);
```

# STEP4: Insert Data (MySQL Syntax)
```sql
/* basic syntax */
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ..., columnN)
VALUES (value1, value2, ..., valueN);

/* insert multiple rows */
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2)
VALUES 
  (value1a, value2a),
  (value1b, value2b),
  (value1c, value2c);

/* insert without specifying columns (must match column order) */
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, ..., valueN);
```

# Insert Into VENDOR Table
```sql
INSERT INTO VENDOR VALUES(21225,'Bryson, Inc.'    ,'Smithson','615','223-3234','TN','Y');

# Data in Database
![bg right:70% w:90%](restricted/CFig08_02.jpg)

# SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Many SQL DML are used to perform actions such as adding or deleting rows or changing attribute values within tables
- Data retrieval is done using SELECT which specifies what data should be retrieved and how it should be filtered, aggregated, and displayed

# Basic SELECT Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]
[GROUP BY column]
[HAVING condition]
[ORDER BY column [ASC|DESC]]
[LIMIT number OFFSET offset];
```

# SELECT Clause
- SELECT – specifies the attributes to be returned (column name or *)
- FROM – specifies the table(s)
- WHERE – filters the rows of data
- GROUP BY – groups the rows of data into collections based on columns
- HAVING – filters the groups formed by GROUP BY clause
- ORDER BY – sorts the final query result rows in ascending or descending order by columns

# Use Wildcard in Expression
A wildcard character is a symbol that can be used as a general substitute for other characters or commands
  - \* : all columns
  - % : matches zero or more characters
  - _ : matches exactly one character

```sql
SELECT * FROM PRODUCT WHERE P_CODE LIKE '15%';
SELECT * FROM PRODUCT WHERE P_CODE LIKE '2232/Q__';
```

# Select an Entire PRODUCT Table
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM EPPS_SALECO.PRODUCT;

USE EPPS_SALECO;
SELECT * 
FROM PRODUCT;
```

# Select with a Column List
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, P_QOH 
FROM EPPS_SALECO.PRODUCT;
```

# Using Column Aliases
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT AS DESCRIPTION, P_PRICE AS "UNIT PRICE", P_QOH AS QTY  
FROM PRODUCT;
```

# Using Computed Columns
```sql
SELECT P_DESCRIPT AS DESCRIPTION, P_PRICE AS "UNIT PRICE", P_QOH AS QTY, P_QOH * P_PRICE AS "TOTAL VALUE"  
FROM PRODUCT;
```
# Numeric Calculation
```sql
SELECT 
P_PRICE as ORG_PRICE,
P_DISCOUNT as DISCOUNT,
P_PRICE * (1 - P_DISCOUNT) as PROD_PRICE 
FROM PRODUCT;
```

# Date Arithmetic
```sql
SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL 7 DAY;
SELECT CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH;
SELECT '2025-04-01' + INTERVAL 1 DAY;
```

# Listing Unique Values
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT V_CODE
FROM PRODUCT;
```

# FROM Clause Options
- The FROM clause specifies table(s) which is involved
- Only columns in tables in FROM clause are available throughout the rest of the query
- Multiple tables must be combined using a type of JOIN operation

# ORDER BY Clause Options

```sql
SELECT 	columnlist
FROM 		tablelist
[ORDER BY	columnlist [ASC|DESC] ];
```  
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_QOH, P_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT
ORDER BY P_PRICE;
```
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_QOH, P_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT
ORDER BY P_PRICE DESC;
```
```sql
SELECT EMP_LNAME, EMP_FNAME, EMP_INITIAL, EMP_PHONE
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY EMP_LNAME, EMP_FNAME, EMP_INITIAL;
```

# WHERE Clause Options
- Comparison operator: =, <, <=, >, >=, <> or !=
```sql
SELECT columnlist
FROM tablelist
[WHERE conditionlist ];
```

# Using Comparison Operator on Numeric Attribute 
```sql
SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_INDATE, P_PRICE, V_CODE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE V_CODE = 21344;

SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_QOH, P_MIN, P_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE P_PRICE <= 10;
```

# Using Comparison Operator on Character Attribute  
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_QOH, P_MIN, P_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE P_CODE < '1558-QW1';
```
# Using Comparison Operator on Date Attribute  
```sql
SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_QOH, P_MIN, P_PRICE, P_INDATE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE P_INDATE >= '2021-11-05';
```
# Logical Operators: AND, OR and NOT
```sql
SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_INDATE, P_PRICE, V_CODE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE P_PRICE < 50 AND P_INDATE > '2021-01-01';

/* use parentheses and compare below two select statements */
SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_CODE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE (V_CODE = 25595 OR V_CODE = 24288) AND P_PRICE > 100;

SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_CODE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE V_CODE = 25595 OR V_CODE = 24288 AND P_PRICE > 100;
-- AND before OR --

SELECT *
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE NOT (V_CODE = 21344);
``` 

# Special Operators in WHERE Clause
- BETWEEN – Used to check whether an attribute value is within a range
- IN – Used to check whether an attribute value matches any value within a value list
- LIKE – Used to check whether an attribute value matches a given string pattern
- IS NULL – Used to check whether an attribute value is null
- NOT – Used to negate a condition

# Illustrations of Special Operators
```sql
SELECT *
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE P_PRICE BETWEEN 50.00 AND 100.00;
SELECT *
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE V_CODE IN (21344, 24288);
SELECT V_NAME, V_CONTACT, V_AREACODE, V_PHONE
FROM VENDOR
WHERE V_CONTACT LIKE 'Smith%';
-- wildcard % for zero or more chars, _ for any one char
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, V_CODE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE V_CODE IS NULL;
SELECT V_NAME, V_CONTACT, V_AREACODE, V_PHONE
FROM VENDOR
WHERE UPPER(V_CONTACT) NOT LIKE 'SMITH%';
```

# MySQL Comparison Operators
Symbol or keyword(s) | Description
---------------------|-------------
=, !=, <> | Equal, Not equal
\>, >=, <, <= | Great / Less than or equal to
is null, is not null | check null or not
between and, not between and | within a range
in, not in | match a value in a list
like, not like | match a pattern

# MySQL Booleans or Conditions
Conditions: not, and, or
Booleans
```sql
create table bachelor (name	varchar(100), employed_flag bool);
	
insert into bachelor(name, employed_flag)
values ('Hector Handsome', true),('Frank Freeloader', false);
select * from bachelor where employed_flag is true;
select * from bachelor where employed_flag;
select * from bachelor where employed_flag = true;
select * from bachelor where employed_flag != false;
select * from bachelor where employed_flag = 1;
select * from bachelor where employed_flag != 0;
```

# JOIN Operations
JOIN operators are used to combine data from multiple tables
- Inner joins return only rows from the tables that match on a common value
- Outer joins return the same matched rows as the inner join, plus unmatched rows from one table or the other
  - Left (outer) join
  - Right (outer) join
  - Full (outer) join

# JOIN Illustration
<div class="grid">
    <img src="files/image/four_join_types.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="files/image/join_example.jpg" alt="">
</div>

# Three Ways to Do Inner Join (Join)
```sql
-- JOIN USING
SELECT column-list FROM table1 JOIN table2 USING (common-column)

-- JOIN ON
SELECT column-list FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON join-condition

-- Old-style JOIN
SELECT column-list FROM table1, table2 WHERE table1.column = table2.column
```
- In practice, **JOIN ON** is typically considered as a preference.

# Example of JOIN USING
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, V_CODE, V_NAME, V_AREACODE, V_PHONE
FROM PRODUCT JOIN VENDOR USING (V_CODE);
```
# Example of JOIN ON
```sql
SELECT INVOICE.INV_NUMBER, PRODUCT.P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, LINE_UNITS, LINE_PRICE
FROM INVOICE
JOIN LINE ON INVOICE.INV_NUMBER = LINE.INV_NUMBER 
JOIN PRODUCT ON LINE.P_CODE = PRODUCT.P_CODE;

-- Compare to JOIN ON
SELECT INV_NUMBER, P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, LINE_UNITS, LINE_PRICE
FROM INVOICE 
JOIN LINE USING(INV_NUMBER) 
JOIN PRODUCT USING(P_CODE);
```

# Example of Old-Style JOIN
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_NAME
FROM PRODUCT, VENDOR
WHERE PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE;

-- Compare to JOIN USING
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_NAME
FROM PRODUCT JOIN VENDOR USING(V_CODE);

-- Compare to JOIN ON
SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_NAME
FROM PRODUCT JOIN VENDOR ON PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE;
```
- The task of joining the tables is split across both the FROM and WHERE which makes complex queries more difficult to maintain
- They are susceptible to undetected errors

# Illustrate Why Old-Style Join is Not Preferred
```sql
-- Get wrong result and easy to find no condition when join PRODUCT
SELECT CUS_FNAME, CUS_LNAME, V_NAME
FROM CUSTOMER
JOIN INVOICE ON CUSTOMER.CUS_CODE = INVOICE.CUS_CODE
JOIN LINE ON INVOICE.INV_NUMBER = LINE.INV_NUMBER
JOIN PRODUCT
JOIN VENDOR ON PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE
WHERE V_STATE = 'TN';

-- Get wrong result and hard to debug
SELECT CUS_FNAME, CUS_LNAME, V_NAME
FROM CUSTOMER, INVOICE, LINE, PRODUCT, VENDOR
WHERE V_STATE = 'TN' 
AND CUSTOMER.CUS_CODE = INVOICE.CUS_CODE 
AND INVOICE.INV_NUMBER = LINE.INV_NUMBER
AND PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE;
```

# Outer Joins
Three types of outer join: Left (outer) join, Right (outer) join, Full (outer) join

# Left Outer Join
```sql
SELECT column-list
FROM table1 LEFT[OUTER] JOIN table2 ON join-condition

SELECT P_CODE, VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME
FROM VENDOR 
LEFT JOIN PRODUCT ON VENDOR.V_CODE = PRODUCT.V_CODE;
```

# Right Outer Join
```sql
SELECT column-list
FROM table1 RIGHT[OUTER] JOIN table2 ON join-condition

SELECT P_CODE, VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME
FROM VENDOR 
RIGHT JOIN PRODUCT ON VENDOR.V_CODE = PRODUCT.V_CODE;

SELECT VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME, P_CODE
FROM PRODUCT 
RIGHT JOIN VENDOR ON PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE
WHERE P_CODE IS NULL;
```

# Full Outer Join (Not Support in MySQL)
```sql
SELECT column-list
FROM table1 FULL[OUTER] JOIN table2 ON join-condition

SELECT P_CODE, VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME
FROM VENDOR
FULL JOIN PRODUCT ON VENDOR.V_CODE = PRODUCT.V_CODE;
```
<div class="middle-grid">
    <img src="restricted/CFig07_33.jpg" alt="">
</div>

# Cross Join
- A cross join performs a relational product (also known as the Cartesian product) of two tables.
- Despite the name, CROSS JOIN is not truly a join operation because it does not unite the rows of the tables based on a common attribute.
```sql
SELECT column-list FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2

SELECT * FROM INVOICE CROSS JOIN LINE;
```

# JOINs in MySQL
![bg right:70% w:90%](files/image/mysql_join.jpg)

# Joining Tables with an Alias
Using a table alias allows the database programmer to improve the maintainability

```sql
SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_NAME, V_CONTACT, V_AREACODE, V_PHONE
FROM
PRODUCT P 
JOIN VENDOR V ON P.V_CODE = V.V_CODE;
```

# Recursive Joins
A query that joins a table to itself
```sql
SELECT E.EMP_NUM, E.EMP_LNAME, E.EMP_MGR, M.EMP_LNAME
FROM EMP E
JOIN EMP M ON E.EMP_MGR = M.EMP_NUM;

# Aggregate Processing
SQL provides useful aggregate functions that count, find minimum and maximum values, calculate averages, etc.
- Count
- MIN and MAX
- SUM and AVG

# Count
```sql
SELECT COUNT(P_CODE)
FROM PRODUCT;

SELECT COUNT(P_PRICE)
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE P_PRICE < 10;

-- count how many V_CODE in PRODUCT which is not NULL
SELECT COUNT(V_CODE)
FROM PRODUCT;

-- count how many rows in the table
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM PRODUCT;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT V_CODE) AS "COUNT DISTINCT"
FROM PRODUCT;
```
# MIN and MAX
The MIN and MAX functions help you find answers to problems such as the highest and lowest (maximum and minimum) prices in the PRODUCT table.
```sql
SELECT MAX(P_PRICE) AS MAXPRICE, MIN(P_PRICE) as MINPRICE
FROM PRODUCT;
```

# SUM and AVG
```sql
SELECT SUM(CUS_BALANCE) AS TOTAL_BALANCE
FROM CUSTOMER;

SELECT SUM(P_QOH * P_PRICE) as TOTAL_VALUE
FROM PRODUCT;

SELECT AVG(P_PRICE) AS AVG_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT;
```
# Grouping Data (1)
```sql
SELECT columnlist
FROM tablelist
[WHERE conditionlist]
[GROUP BY columnlist]
[ORDER BY columnlist [ASC|DESC]];

SELECT V_CODE, AVG(P_PRICE) AS AVG_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT
GROUP BY V_CODE;

SELECT VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME, COUNT(P_CODE) AS NUMPRODS, AVG(P_PRICE) AS AVGPRICE
FROM PRODUCT JOIN VENDOR ON PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE
GROUP BY V_CODE
ORDER BY V_NAME;
```

# Grouping Data (2)
```sql
-- Get execution error
SELECT VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME, P_QOH, COUNT(P_CODE) AS NUMPRODS, AVG(P_PRICE) AS AVGPRICE
FROM PRODUCT JOIN VENDOR ON PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE
GROUP BY V_CODE
ORDER BY V_NAME;

-- Fixed 1: sum of P_QOH
SELECT VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME, SUM(P_QOH), COUNT(P_CODE) AS NUMPRODS, AVG(P_PRICE) AS AVGPRICE
FROM PRODUCT JOIN VENDOR ON PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE
GROUP BY V_CODE
ORDER BY V_NAME;

-- Fixed 2: put P_QOH into group by
SELECT VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME, P_QOH, COUNT(P_CODE) AS NUMPRODS, AVG(P_PRICE) AS AVGPRICE
FROM PRODUCT JOIN VENDOR ON PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE
GROUP BY V_CODE, P_QOH
ORDER BY V_NAME;
```

# HAVING Clause
```sql
SELECT columnlist FROM tablelist
[WHERE conditionlist]
[GROUP BY columnlist]
[HAVING conditionlist]
[ORDER BY columnlist [ASC|DESC]];

SELECT V_CODE, COUNT(P_CODE) AS NUMPRODS
FROM PRODUCT
GROUP BY V_CODE
HAVING AVG(P_PRICE) < 10
ORDER BY V_CODE;

SELECT P.V_CODE, V_NAME, SUM(P_QOH * P_PRICE) AS TOTCOST
FROM PRODUCT P JOIN VENDOR V ON P.V_CODE = V.V_CODE
WHERE P_DISCOUNT > 0
GROUP BY V_CODE, V_NAME
HAVING (SUM(P_QOH * P_PRICE) > 500)
ORDER BY SUM(P_QOH * P_PRICE) DESC;
```

# Subqueries
We want to generate a list of vendors who do not provide products.
```sql
-- Right outer join
SELECT VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME 
FROM PRODUCT
RIGHT JOIN VENDOR ON PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE
WHERE P_CODE IS NULL;

-- Subquery
SELECT V_CODE, V_NAME
FROM VENDOR
WHERE V_CODE NOT IN (
    SELECT V_CODE FROM PRODUCT WHERE V_CODE IS NOT NULL);
```

# WHERE Subqueries
```sql
-- List all customers who order a claw hammer
SELECT P_CODE, P_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE P_PRICE >= 
    (SELECT AVG(P_PRICE) FROM PRODUCT);

SELECT DISTINCT CUS_CODE, CUS_LNAME, CUS_FNAME
FROM CUSTOMER
JOIN INVOICE USING (CUS_CODE)
JOIN LINE USING (INV_NUMBER)
JOIN PRODUCT USING (P_CODE)
WHERE P_CODE = (
    SELECT P_CODE
    FROM PRODUCT
    WHERE P_DESCRIPT = 'Claw hammer');

SELECT DISTINCT CUSTOMER.CUS_CODE, CUS_LNAME, CUS_FNAME
FROM CUSTOMER
JOIN INVOICE ON CUSTOMER.CUS_CODE = INVOICE.CUS_CODE
JOIN LINE ON INVOICE.INV_NUMBER = LINE.INV_NUMBER
JOIN PRODUCT ON PRODUCT.P_CODE = LINE.P_CODE
WHERE P_DESCRIPT = 'Claw hammer';    
```

# IN Subqueries
List all customers who have purchased hammers, saws, or saw blades.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CUSTOMER.CUS_CODE, CUS_LNAME, CUS_FNAME
FROM CUSTOMER
JOIN INVOICE ON CUSTOMER.CUS_CODE = INVOICE.CUS_CODE
JOIN LINE ON INVOICE.INV_NUMBER = LINE.INV_NUMBER
JOIN PRODUCT ON LINE.P_CODE = PRODUCT.P_CODE
WHERE PRODUCT.P_CODE IN
  (SELECT P_CODE 
   FROM PRODUCT
   WHERE P_DESCRIPT LIKE '%hammer%' OR P_DESCRIPT LIKE '%saw%');
```

# HAVING Subqueries
List all products with a total quantity sold greater than the average quantity sold
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, SUM(LINE_UNITS) AS TOTALUNITS
FROM LINE
GROUP BY P_CODE
HAVING SUM(LINE_UNITS) > (SELECT AVG(LINE_UNITS) FROM LINE);
```

# Multirow Subquery Operators: ALL and any
Which products cost more than all individual products provided by vendors from Florida
```sql
SELECT P_CODE, P_QOH * P_PRICE AS TOTALVALUE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE P_QOH * P_PRICE > 
    ALL (SELECT P_QOH * P_PRICE
         FROM PRODUCT
         WHERE V_CODE IN 
         (SELECT V_CODE
          FROM VENDOR 
          WHERE V_STATE = 'FL'));
```

- <span class="small-text"> Greater than ALL" is equivalent to "greater than the highest product cost of the list </span>
- <span class="small-text"> ANY operator to compare a single value to a list of values and select only the rows for which the inventory cost is greater than any value in the list</span>
- <span class="small-text"> Use the equal to ANY operator, which would be the equivalent of the IN operator.</span>

# FROM Subqueries
List all customers who purchased both products ('13-Q2/P2', '23109-HB'), not just one.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CUSTOMER.CUS_CODE, CUSTOMER.CUS_LNAME
FROM CUSTOMER
JOIN
    (SELECT INVOICE.CUS_CODE
     FROM INVOICE
     JOIN LINE ON INVOICE.INV_NUMBER = LINE.INV_NUMBER
     WHERE P_CODE = '13-Q2/P2') CP1
ON CUSTOMER.CUS_CODE = CP1.CUS_CODE
JOIN
    (SELECT INVOICE.CUS_CODE
     FROM INVOICE
     JOIN LINE ON INVOICE.INV_NUMBER = LINE.INV_NUMBER
     WHERE P_CODE = '23109-HB') CP2
ON CP1.CUS_CODE = CP2.CUS_CODE;
```

# Attribute List Subqueries (1)
List the difference between each product's price and the average product price
```sql
SELECT 
  P_CODE, P_PRICE,
  (SELECT AVG(P_PRICE) FROM PRODUCT) AS AVGPRICE,
  P_PRICE - (SELECT AVG(P_PRICE) FROM PRODUCT) AS DIFF
FROM PRODUCT;
```

# Attribute List Subqueries (2)
List the product code, the total sales by product, and the contribution by employee of each product's sales.
```sql
SELECT
P_CODE, 
SUM(LINE_UNITS * LINE_PRICE) AS SALES,
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEE) AS ECOUNT,
SUM(LINE_UNITS * LINE_PRICE)/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEE) AS CONTRIB
FROM LINE
GROUP BY P_CODE;

SELECT P_CODE, SALES, ECOUNT, SALES/ECOUNT AS CONTRIB
FROM (SELECT P_CODE, 
             SUM(LINE_UNITS * LINE_PRICE) AS SALES,
             (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEE) AS ECOUNT 
      FROM LINE
      GROUP BY P_CODE) AS T;
```

# Correlated Subqueries (Definition)
- <span class="blue-text">Inner subquery</span>
  - Inner subqueries execute independently. 
  - The inner sub-query executes first; its **output** is used by the outer query, which then executes until the
last outer query finishes (the first SQL statement in the code).
- <span class="blue-text">Correalted subquery</span>
  -  A subquery that executes once for each row in the outer query.
  -  The inner query is related to the outer query
  -  The inner query references a column of the outer subquery.
  1. It initiates the outer query.
  2. For each row of the outer query result set, it executes the inner query by passing the outer row to the inner query.

# Correlated Subqueries (Example)
List all product sales in which the units sold value is greater than the average units sold value for that product (as opposed to the average for all products).
1. Compute the average units sold for a product.
2. Compare the average computed in Step 1 to the units sold in each sale row, and then select only the rows in which the number of units sold is greater.

# Correlated Subqueries (SQL)
```sql
SELECT INV_NUMBER, P_CODE, LINE_UNITS
FROM LINE LS
WHERE LS.LINE_UNITS > (SELECT AVG(LINE_UNITS)
                       FROM LINE LA
                       WHERE LA.P_CODE = LS.P_CODE);

SELECT INV_NUMBER, P_CODE, LINE_UNITS, (SELECT AVG(LINE_UNITS)
                                        FROM LINE LX
                                        WHERE LX.P_CODE = LS.P_CODE) AS AVG
FROM LINE LS
WHERE LS.LINE_UNITS > (SELECT AVG(LINE_UNITS)
                       FROM LINE LA
                       WHERE LA.P_CODE = LS.P_CODE);                            
```
# Correlated Subqueries (Exists)
```sql
-- list all vendors, but only if there are products to order.
SELECT *
FROM VENDOR
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM PRODUCT WHERE P_QOH <= P_MIN * 2);

-- list the names of all customers who have placed an order lately.
SELECT CUS_CODE, CUS_LNAME, CUS_FNAME
FROM CUSTOMER
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT CUS_CODE 
              FROM INVOICE
              WHERE INVOICE.CUS_CODE = CUSTOMER.CUS_CODE);
```

# Correlated Subqueries (Example of Exists)
Suppose that you want to know what vendors you must contact to order products that are approaching the minimum quantity-on-hand value that is less than double the minimum quantity.

```sql
SELECT V_CODE, V_NAME
FROM VENDOR
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT *
              FROM PRODUCT
              WHERE P_QOH < P_MIN * 2 AND VENDOR.V_CODE = PRODUCT.V_CODE);
```
