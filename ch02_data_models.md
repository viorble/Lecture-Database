# Chapter 2: Data Models

- Data modeling is to build data models, which is the first step in the database design journey, `<span class="brown-text">`serving as a bridge between real-world objects and the computer database.
- One big problem of database design is that designers, programmers, and end users see data in different ways, which introduce `<span class="brown-text">`misunderstanding and increase communication cost.
- `<span class="brown-text">`Database designers must obtain a precise description (`<span class="brown-text">`data model) of the data's nature and environments within the organization to reduce communication efforts.

# Data Modeling and Data Models

- Data modeling refers to the `<span class="brown-text">`process of creating a specific data model for a determined problem domain (mini-world).
- Data modeling is an iterative, progressive process.
- A `<span class="brown-text">`data model is a relatively simple representation of more complex real-world objects
  - Entity (table)
  - Attribute (column)
  - Relationship (linkage between tables)
  - Constrain

# The Importance of Data Models

- Data models are a `<span class="brown-text">`communication tool
  - End users know the business rule running in real world
  - Developers develop aps to manage data and transform data into information
  - People view data in different ways
    - Managers want a universal view of data
    - Staffs need details of data
- A good database system environment requires an overall database design based on an appropriate data model
- No appropriate data model, no good database system environment

# Data Model Basic Building Blocks

- An `<span class="brown-text">`entity is a person, thing or event about which data will be collected and stored
- An `<span class="brown-text">`attribute is a characteristic (property) of an entity
- A `<span class="brown-text">`relationship describes an association among entities
  - One-to-many (1:M or 1..*): PAINTER paints PAINTING
  - Many-to-many (M:N or \*..\*): EMPLOYEE learn SKILL
  - One-to-one (1:1 or 1..1): EMPLOYEE manage STORE
- A `<span class="brown-text">`constraint is a restriction placed on the data to help data integrity
  - An employee’s salary must have values between 6,000 and 350,000
  - Each class must have one and only one teacher

# Business Rules

- A **business rule** is a brief, precise, and unambiguous description of a policy, procedure, or principle within a specific organization
  - made from company managers, policy makers, department managers, and written procedures
  - used to define entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints
- Example: A customer may generate many invoices' may be translated into data model
  - Customer and invoice are objects of interest and should be represented by respective `<span class="brown-text">`entities
  - There is a **'generate'** `<span class="brown-text">`relationship between customer and invoice
  - The generate relationship is one-to-many (1:M)

# Naming Conventions

- Names should be descriptive and familiar to the users
- A good naming convention can
  - Make less confusion and reduce errors
  - Promote code consistently and readability
- Follow organization practice or develop at the start of project by considering
  - Should table name and column name be singular or plural? (student or students)
  - Should prefix tables or columns? (name or prod_name)
  - Should use capital letters for naming? (cap_cap, capCap or CapCap)
  - Which terminology should be selected? (user, person or people)

# The Evolution of Data Models

Data models represent a lot of thought as to what a database is, what it should do, the types of structures that it should employ, and the technology that would be used to implement these structures
![bg right:55% w:700 data models evolution](restricted/CFig02_05.jpg)

# Hierarchical Models

- The hierarchical model organizes the data into a tree structure which consist of a single root node where each record is having a parent record and many child records and expands like a tree
  ![bg right:50% w:600 hierarchical models](files/image/hierarchical_model.png)

# Network Models

- In the network model, the user perceives the network database as a collection of records in 1:M relationships. However, unlike the hierarchical model, the network model allows a record to have more than one parent.
  ![bg right:50% w:600 network model](https://www.myreadingroom.co.in/images/stories/docs/dbms/Network%20Data%20Model.JPG)

# Database Concepts Inherited from Network Model

- The `<span class="brown-text">`**schema** is the conceptual and structural definition of a whole database. Once you claim the schema of a database, it must now no longer be modified often because it will distort the data organization inside the Database.
- The `<span class="brown-text">`**data manipulation language (DML)** defines the way to insert, read, update, delete data in database
- A `<span class="brown-text">`**schema data definition language (DDL)** enables the DBA to define the schema components (create, drop, alter table, create index or trigger)

# Relational Model

The relational model’s foundation is a mathematical concept known as a relation, which is introduced by Edgar F. Codd in 1969.

- Relation: a table with columns and rows.
- Attribute: a named column of a relation.
- Domain: the set of allowable values for one or more attributes.
- Tuple: a row of a relation

# Supplement of Relational Model

- Relation schema
- Relational database schema
- Degree of a relation
- Cardinality of a relation
- Relation state (or relation instance)
  [Relational model terminology](https://youtu.be/Q45sr5p_NmQ?si=cr53etNXoX1BIpLf)

# Entity Relationship Model

- Although the relational model was a vast improvement over the hierarchical and network models, it still lacked the features that would make it an effective database design tool.
- Database designers prefer to use a graphical tool in which entities and their relationships are pictured.
- The `<span class="brown-text">`**entity relationship model (ERM)** using *graphical representations* to model database components has become a widely accepted standard for data modeling.
- The relational data model and ERM combined to provide the foundation for tightly structured database design

# Entity Relationship Model Notation

- Entity – an entity is represented in the ERD by a rectangle (entity box)
- Attributes – each entity consists of a set of attributes that describes particular characteristics of the entity
- Relationships – relationships describe associations among data

# Relational Model vs Entity Relationship Model

ER Model first, then converted into Relational Model for DBMS implementation.

| Aspect         | ER Model                            | Relational Model                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Used For       | Conceptual database design          | Logical database implementation       |
| Representation | ER Diagram (graphical)              | Tables (relational schema)            |
| Elements       | Entities, Attributes, Relationships | Tables, Attributes, Tuples            |
| Constraints    | Cardinality in ER Diagram           | Primary/Foreign keys, SQL constraints |
| Conversion     | Converted to Relational Model       | Implemented in DBMS                   |

# Object-Oriented Model

In the object-oriented data model (OODM), both data and its relationship are contained in a single structure known as an object

- **Object**: an abstraction of a real-world entity
- **Attributes**: describe the properties of an object
- **Method**: represents a real-world action
- **Class**: a collection of similar objects with shared structure and behavior
- **Inheritance**: an object within the *class hierarchy* to inherit the attributes and methods of the classes above it. (class EMPLOYEE and CUSTOMER can be created as subclasses inherit from the class PERSON)
- OODM are typically depicted using Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams

# OODM Diagram

![bg right:70% w:100%](files/image/CFig02_04.jpeg)

# ERDM and O/R DBMS

- The extended relational data model (ERDM) adds many of the OO model’s features within the simpler relational database structure
- A DBMS based on the ERDM is an object/relational database management system (O/R DBMS)

- Big Data characteristics (3 Vs) : volume, velocity, and variety
- Most frequently used Big Data technologies
  - Hadoop: an **ecosystem** provides a collection of softwares to operate big data
  - Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a fault-tolerant **file storage** system
  - MapReduce is an distributed **computational framework**
